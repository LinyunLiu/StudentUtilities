# StudentUtilities
This web programming project aims to develop a utility webpage for university students

# Introduction
our team used multiple technologies, including Node.js, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, 
to create a webpage with six features.

* We integrated external APIs into the webpages, showing our ability to leverage the functionality 
of other systems to enhance the application. This expands the range of what is possible and allows 
integration of features that are already built.

* The inclusion of six features in our webpage, each with its own set of functionalities, demonstrates 
our proficiency in developing complex applications.

* The webpage provides practical functionality, such as a to-do list, file converter, calculator, AI tools, 
citation machine, and YouTube downloader, making it useful for everyday tasks. Often students have to scour 
the internet for the tools and are unable to find them all aggregated at one place. This application makes 
the tools available at one place.

* The application requires local servers running which would be mitigated in an ideal situation where the 
application would be hosted on a remote server. However, since the scope of the problem is limited, we 
were fine with testing and hosting servers locally.

There is too much code to highlight, but if we were to highlight the code, it would be the code in 
each of the files that interact with the server and the API. Another candidate could be the cohesive styling 
choices that make the website aesthetically pleasing.

The unique features our webpage has it that all these features are shown on one interface, to make it easily accessible. 
Ideally this webpage is good for students that have a hard time making it around the web. Our webpage provides additionally 
links to guide users as well.
